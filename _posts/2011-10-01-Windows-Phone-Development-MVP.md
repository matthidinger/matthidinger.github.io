I’m really honored to be part of a community that really values knowledge sharing and continuous professional growth such as this. Over the past few years I’ve come to greatly respect and appreciate the vast amount of personal time that many people in the development community (both MVPs and non-MVPs) contribute to help drive our profession forward.

I’d also like to offer a very special thanks to the entire Windows Phone Dev community for helping to expand this great platform into the consumer reach that it deserves. There is still a ways to go, but after the impressive world-wide launch of Mango across dozens of countries, carriers, and OEMs **on a single day** I think we can all agree that Microsoft is taking this seriously. I’m personally really excited to be in on the ground floor this platform!

### Chicago Community

And of course to anyone in Chicagoland who is at least slightly curious about Windows Phone development, don’t miss our [Chicago Windows Phone Developer group](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Windows-Phone-Developers/) meetings on the first Thursday of every month at 200 S Wacker.

### Thanks!

Thanks again to the entire development community for investing so much of your personal time to speaking, training, blogging, and critiquing the tools and platforms we use every day!
