### This blog is quiet… too quiet.

It’s been a busy couple of months since starting at [Clarity](http://claritycon.com/) in January. PowerPoint, for better or worse, became my after-hours IDE. Below you will find some of the recent talks accompanied by their slides and code. Hopefully I didn’t forget anything, but please shoot me a comment if I did!

### WindyCityGo

#### Apr 5 – 6, 2012

[WindyCityGo](http://windycitygo.org/) is a two-day conference in Chicago that covers all things mobile.

This year they added Windows Phone to their lineup and I was invited to speak on “Real World Windows Phone Development.” My talk covered an intro to metro and supports my [tutorial series on building a polished Stocks app for windows phone](http://www.matthidinger.com/archive/2011/10/16/RealWorldWPDev-Part-1-Introduction-and-Outline.aspx).

And now that my speaking gigs are winding down I can finally get back to that series!

### Windows 8 Anchor at Navy Pier

#### Apr 26, 2012

This event was put on by Microsoft to help get our excellent mid-west developers ready for Windows 8.

Since Clarity had been using the consumer preview tools to build a few metro-style apps already, [Erik Klimczak](https://twitter.com/#!/eklimcz) and I were invited to talk about “Windows 8 from the Trenches.” We really wanted to cover our experience from three perspectives: business, design, and development.

Overall this was a very exciting event with nearly 400 people eager to see what’s coming with windows 8 and this new metro design language.

### StirTrek

#### May 4, 2012

[StirTrek](http://stirtrek.com/) is one of the coolest conferences I’ve been to so far. My buddy [Clark Sell](http://csell.net) and I flew out to Columbus for the one-day event that takes place at a movie theater. This was StirTrek’s fourth year and they impressively sold out 1,000 tickets in under 10 minutes.

My talk was on “WinJS for C\# Developers” where I gave a crash course into JavaScript development from a C\# perspective. I ended up building a Stocks app on stage, on one of the worst market days in recent memory. It always makes for a good demo to show people how much money they are losing!

That said, thankfully I did not have to compete with Scott Hansleman in my time slot. My condolences for those who did!
