I apologize this is a week late. Below is a zip which includes the slides and solution from my presentation on [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/).

It should serve as a pretty good reference application for how to implement the most common functionality in Caliburn.Micro. I’ve also included a simple HTTP framework which can take advantage of Caliburn’s Coroutines to easily issue GET requests and parse the JSON response into a typed model.
