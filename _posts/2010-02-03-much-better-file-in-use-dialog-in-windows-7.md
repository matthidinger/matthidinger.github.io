A very welcomed addition to the all-too-common File In Use dialog when trying to delete a file that a process has locked.

As you can see from the screenshot, the dialog in Windows 7 *finally* tells the user exactly which process is preventing the deletion. No longer do I need [Process Monitor](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx) from SysInternals for such a simple need.
