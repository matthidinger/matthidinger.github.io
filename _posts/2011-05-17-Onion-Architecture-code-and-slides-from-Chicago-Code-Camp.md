This past Saturday was the third annual [Chicago Code Camp](https://chicagocodecamp.com/). If you missed it and you’re in the area, be sure to attend next year! It’s free, and organized by a great group of community leaders here in the greater Chicagoland area.

My talk this year was on Onion Architecture. A slight variation of the “ports and adapters” application architecture, I first started reading and prototyping the concepts introduced by [Jeffrey Palermo](https://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/). Check out his blog if you want to read a bit more on it.

If you happened to attend my presentation and have any feedback please do let me know! Next year I hope they will be bringing speaker evaluations back – as I greatly appreciate any input on my speaking ability, constructive or otherwise!
