I will be giving a talk at the [Chicago Architects Group](https://chicagoarchitectsgroup.com/) on Onion Architecture next week, details below. This is a completely free event, and of course, pizza will be provided.

### When

**Tuesday, April 20, 2010 from 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM (CT)**

### Where

**TechNexus
200 S Wacker Drive
Suite 1500
Chicago, IL 60606**

### Abstract

**Onion Architecture**

by **Matt Hidinger**

Onion architecture exploits well-known patterns like dependency injection to promote true loose coupling between the core business logic and technical implementation details of an application.  Join us as we discuss this approach to building robust applications.

Followed by open forum
