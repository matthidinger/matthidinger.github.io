I’ve just finished my new app called Transit Directions. As the name hopefully implies, the app helps people get around a city with public transit. It will provide step-by-step directions for 11 cities, with an interactive map to aid the experience. I spent a bunch of time polishing this app to replicate the native Bing Maps app experience, hopefully it paid off. I assume this functionality will be built into the native app with the Mango phone update, but it’s free now and forever, so get it while it’s hot!

I’ve just finished my new app called Transit Directions. As the name hopefully implies, the app helps people get around a city with public transit.

I spent a bunch of time polishing this app to replicate the native Bing Maps app experience, hopefully it paid off.

I assume this functionality will be built into the native app with the Mango phone update, so this baby has a limited shelf-life. **But it’s free now and forever, so get it while it’s hot!**
